* YouTube Playlists (the public ones).
* Spotify Playlists/Albums.

## Why did I make it ❓
#### Come on, let's be honest here, we all wanted to listen to that one playlist(or album) to which we've been adding songs over a long time on spotify or youtube but we've tons of annoying ads. And we wanna listen to those songs offline too! but don't wanna pay 😬 so that's when I decided to make this app.
