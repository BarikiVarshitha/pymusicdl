# Hola! 
## What does this app do? 🤨
#### Well this is a simple python app which uses different libraries to basically download music. It downloads:
* Single songs.
* YouTube Playlists (the public ones).
* Spotify Playlists.

## Why did I make it ❓
#### Come on, let's be honest here, we all wanted to listen to that one playlist to which we've been adding songs over a long time on spotify or youtube but we've tons of annoying ads. And we wanna listen to those songs offline too! but don't wanna pay 😬 so that's when I decided to make this app.

## Who is this for?
#### You! (basically anyone who loves listening to music).

## What should you know to get started with this app?
#### You don't have to know anything technical about programming or whatever. Just know how to install stuff and how to open stuff lol. And have [Python 3.x](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-383/) installed.

## What should you do to get this app rolling?
    Follow the following steps carefully. The setup could be a bugger. But the reward is worth it.

## Here's what you have to do if you're on Windows:

#### Get the stuff:

* Install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.8.3/python-3.8.3-amd64.exe)
* Install Git
    * Use [this](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.30.2.windows.1/Git-2.30.2-32-bit.exe) if you're on 32-bit
    * Use [this](https://github.com/git-for-windows/git/releases/download/v2.30.2.windows.1/Git-2.30.2-64-bit.exe) if you're on 64-bit

* Now open `Git` that you've just installed (start-> search 'git' -> open). Do all of the stuff below in it.

### Now comes the real CoDiNg stuff
